It was a particularly exciting I/O for me, as it was the first time Google has talked publicly about <a href=\"http://d.android.com/jetpackcompose\">Jetpack Compose</a>, the project I was hired to work on in February of 2018.</p>\n<p>Compose is an ambitious multi-team effort to reimagine Android’s UI Toolkit more than 10 years after the Android Platform launched with the original UI Toolkit.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t yet watched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsStyq4Lzxo\">session on Declarative UI Patterns</a>, you should do that now. It is a proper overview of the motivations and goals behind the project.</p>\n<iframe \n  style=\"width:100%;height:320px;\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsStyq4Lzxo\" \n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n  allowfullscreen\n></iframe>\n<p>Compose is <em>extremely early</em>. It is currently “pre-alpha” (if that’s a thing?), which essentially means that it’s nowhere near done, pretty much everything is subject to change, and we make absolutely no guarantees around API stability. For now, we ask that you <strong>do NOT use Compose in your production apps until we say it is ready</strong>.</p>\n<p>One might ask: </p>\n<p><em>If this is the case, why even open source it?</em></p>\n<p>One reason we decided to open source Compose in such an early state is because in many ways, moving over to it will represent a <strong>real paradigm shift in terms of UI development on Android</strong>, and we wanted to get the community used to the ideas embodied by this new framework.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, however, that if all of this talk of change overwhelms you or concerns you, <em>don’t worry</em>. There is <em>no need for you to learn any of this now</em>, and there is a long time between now and when you will need to know how to work with Compose in order to do Android development.</p>\n<p>I am planning on writing several blogs about Compose’s architecture and doing technical deep dives around parts of the architecture that I think are interesting or useful for the community to understand. Writing takes time though, and some of these first articles I want to make sure and get right. In the meantime, there are a lot of interested folks in the Android community that are eager to understand more about this new direction.</p>\n<p>Given that many of these </p>\n<p>Rethinking Best Practices: Pete Hunt (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY\">https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY</a>)\nThis was the 2nd public talks given about React. The first public talk about react was met with a lot of skepticism and public backlash. This talk does a much better job describing the thinking behind React, and the problems it solves, at a time where writing UI in the way that you do with React was very new and not well understood.  Keep in mind while watching this that it is directed primarily at a “web” crowd.</p>\n<p>OSCON 2014 – React’s Architecture (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/eCf5CquV_Bw\">https://youtu.be/eCf5CquV_Bw</a>)\nGood talk going over some of the origin of react, and some of the architectural decisions there.</p>\n<p>Christopher Chedeau: Why does React Scale? (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/D-ioDiacTm8\">https://youtu.be/D-ioDiacTm8</a>)\nThis talk goes over some of the thinking behind React’s architecture that has been done specifically to make React scale for large organizations (solving the problems that facebook has). Some interesting points that you might not think of out of the bat.</p>\n<p>Ryan Florence - ‹Rethinker stop={false}/› (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/kp-NOggyz54\">https://youtu.be/kp-NOggyz54</a>)\nThis is a great talk given by Ryan Florence that demonstrates some new ways to think about using React. Good demonstration and good discussion from a great public speaker.</p>\n<p>Jessica Kerr - Functional Principles In React (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1uRC3hmKQnM\">https://youtu.be/1uRC3hmKQnM</a>)\nIf you’re not super familiar with functional programming, or maybe even you are, but it’s not clear why React is “functional” (it kind of looks like OOP), this is a great talk to explain the “functional” side of react, and why it’s a good thing :)</p>\n<p>Guillermo Rauch - Pure UI (<a href=\"https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui\">https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui</a>)\nClear expression of the benefits of building UIs composed of components.</p>\n<p>Dan Abramov - Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel (Conference Talk) (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs\">https://youtu.be/xsSnOQynTHs</a>)\nThis video was the announcement of redux, which Dan Abramov made for this talk. It goes into a lot of the thinking behind it and how it was different from flux. Really great talk.</p>\n<p>A Complete Guide to useEffect\n<a href=\"https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/\">https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/</a></p>\n<p>React as a UI Runtime\n<a href=\"https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/\">https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/</a></p>\n<p>React Today and Tomorrow - Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov - React Conf 2018\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ</a></p>\n<p>90% Cleaner React With Hooks\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLf18DsV-I&#x26;t=1s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLf18DsV-I&#x26;t=1s</a></p>",
